    "The requirement is to add async support with retries, which implies the system needs to handle non-blocking I/O operations and recover from transient failures.",
    "Given the project structure, `llm.py` is likely responsible for interacting with external APIs or services, making it the primary candidate for async implementation.",
    "Using `aiohttp` allows for efficient asynchronous HTTP requests, while `tenacity` provides a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff.",
    "Adding a `retry_on_failure` decorator ensures that any failed API call will automatically retry up to a specified number of times.",
    "Modifying `utils.py` to include helper functions for async execution and retry handling keeps the code modular and reusable.",
    "Testing is essential to ensure that the async and retry logic works as expected, especially under failure conditions."
